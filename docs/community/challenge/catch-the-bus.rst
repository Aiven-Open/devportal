Catch the bus - Aiven challenge with ClickHouse®
===============

Welcome to Aiven "Catch the bus" challenge, an easy way for you to explore Aiven for ClickHouse®. 

With the launch of Aiven for ClickHouse we finally have the "C" for our KFC stack, the best combination of tools for real-time alert and historic analytics. The stack utilises Apache Kafka, Apache Flink, and ClickHouse to build up a robust, scalable architecture for getting the most from your data, whether it be batched ETL or real-time sensors.

For this challenge, we'll be using real-time data from `digitransit<https://digitransit.fi/en/developers/apis/4-realtime-api/>` to plot maps and find new insights. Digitransit provides real-time bus informantion and positioning information for busses in Helsinki. We've saved out a few weeks worth of data as a CSV to experiemnt with.

Let's dive right in.
