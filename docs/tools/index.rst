Tools for Aiven
===============

Our goal is to make developers' lives better, so we provide the tools you need to do your work - your way.

The Aiven `web console <https://console.aiven.io>`_ is the friendliest way to get started and to explore something new or get an easy overview of what's happening with your Aiven account.

Use the :doc:`cli` for scriptable, repeatable actions with Aiven - or because the terminal is your natural habitat!

With an :doc:`API <api/index>` you can build any integration you choose. This public-facing API also powers our own web interface so everything you need is supported.

The :doc:`terraform` is a great choice when managing your infrastructure with code.
