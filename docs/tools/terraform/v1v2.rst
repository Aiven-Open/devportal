Upgrading the Aiven Terraform Provider from v1 to v2
====================================================

Version 2 of the Aiven Terraform Provider was released in `October of
2020 <https://aiven.io/blog/aiven-terraform-provider-v2-release>`__.
If you are already using Terraform version: 0.12+ and/or Aiven Terraform provider: 1.3.x and ready to upgrade, will walk you through the process.

To handle the various versions of Terraform, we will be using the great
tool: `tfenv <https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv>`__, but you can use
direct releases from Hashicorp as you like.

Notable changes
---------------

-  Billing Groups have been introduced instead of needing to provide
   Card ID
-  Work is being done to deprecate ``aiven_service`` in order to support
   individual service configuration better, using ``aiven_kafka`` for
   example
-  New resources has been added to the Aiven Terraform provider, such as
   ``aiven_flink``, ``aiven_opensearch``, etc.
-  More details of all of the changes can be found in the
   `Changelog <https://github.com/aiven/terraform-provider-aiven/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`__.

Upgrade Terraform
-----------------

If your existing Terraform code is using 0.12 syntax,
then you need to upgrade your modules first by installing Terraform v0.13.x (i.e. 0.13.7):
``tfenv install 0.13.7 && tfenv use 0.13.7`` and using ``0.13upgrade`` tool.

Update ``required_version`` from ``>= 0.12`` to ``>= 0.13`` in your
``versions.tf`` file if you have any.

If you already using Terraform version 1.0.x you don't need to do any syntax migration
and you can skip ``0.13upgrade`` step.

You will likely have an existing state file, by running:
``terraform state replace-provider registry.terraform.io/-/aiven registry.terraform.io/aiven/aiven``
you will replace old Aiven terraform provider references to the new
format.

Edit the providers block of your script to include the latest version of
the Aiven Terraform Provider (v2.3.1 as of 5th November 2021)

::

    terraform {
      required_providers {
        aiven = {
          source = "aiven/aiven"
          version = "2.3.1"
        }
      }
    }

After that you can run: ``terraform 0.13upgrade`` to see fixes
recommended by Hashicorp.
If you are using more providers than Aiven provider you most likely need to upgrade them as well.
More information `here <https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html>`__.

Now we can remove the old Terraform folder ``rm -rf ~/.terraform.d``.

Let's upgrade Terraform and providers.

Any version above 0.13 will be fine, here we use the latest (1.0.10 as
of 5th November 2021) ``tfenv install latest && tfenv use latest``

Run ``terraform init -upgrade``

Run ``terraform plan``

You may see warnings or errors like the above, these will point towards
changes made between the release you are running and the latest release.

The warnings will provide recommendations on the changes to make and you

Migrating away from ``aiven_service`` to the ``aiven_X`` service specific resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Migration strategy â€“ since ``aiven_service`` and ``aiven_X``, i.e.
``aiven_kafka`` are different kind of resources just by rewriting code
we would cause destructive actions.

Also running ``terraform state mv <a> <b>`` will not do it because it is
a different resource type.

To solve it we would have to:

-  Change the code first
-  Backup your Terraform state file (if available), just in case of potential rollback
-  Remove old resource from the state
-  Import already existing service to the Terraform state.

To change from the old ``aiven_service.kf`` to the new ``aiven_kafka``
resource, resource type should be changed as well as ``service_type``
should be removed.

Also all the references should be updated from the
``aiven_service.kf.x`` to the ``aiven_kafka.kf.x``.

::

    - resource "aiven_service" "kafka" {
    -    service_type            = "kafka"
    + resource "aiven_kafka" "kafka" {
        ...
    }
    resource "aiven_service_user" "kafka_user" {
      project      = var.aiven_project_name
    -  service_name = aiven_service.kafka.service_name
    +  service_name = aiven_kafka.kafka.service_name
      username     = var.kafka_user_name
    }

Here is the example of the remaining steps:

::

    $ terraform state list | grep kf

    ## You could test a potential change with either "-dry-run" flag
    ## terraform state rm -dry-run aiven_service.kf

    $ terraform state rm -backup=./ aiven_service.kf

    $ terraform import aiven_kafka.kf mischa-demo/kafka-test-gr0gu
    $ terraform plan
    $ terraform apply
