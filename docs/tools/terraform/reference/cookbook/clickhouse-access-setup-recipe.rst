Manage user's access for Terraform-deployed ClickHouse速 services
================================================================

This article shows by way of example how to set up user's permissions for a Terraform project containing a managed ClickHouse速 service. It details how to grant the administrator's (read and write) access and the analyst's (read) access.

Prerequisites
-------------

* `Download and install Terraform <https://www.terraform.io/downloads>`_.
* `Sign up <https://console.aiven.io/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=devportal&utm_content=repo>`_ for Aiven if you haven't already.
* `Generate an authentication token <https://docs.aiven.io/docs/platform/howto/create_authentication_token.html>`_.

    For information on what types of access you can grant to your project, see `Project members and roles <https://docs.aiven.io/docs/platform/concepts/projects_accounts_access.html#project-members-and-roles>`_.

Let's cook!
-----------

Imagine that you are collecting IoT measurements from thousands of sensors and these metrics are populated in an Apache Kafka速 topic called ``iot_measurements``.

You may wish to create an Aiven for ClickHouse速 service along with a database containing IoT sensor measurements and
correct permissions for two roles: a writer role that will be allowed to insert data, and an analyst role that will
be allowed to query data.

.. dropdown:: Expand to check out the relevant common files needed for this recipe.

    Navigate to a new folder and add the following files.

    1. Add the following to a new ``provider.tf`` file:

    .. code:: terraform

       terraform {
	 required_providers {
	   aiven = {
	     source  = "aiven/aiven"
	     version = ">= 3.8"
	   }
	 }
       }

       provider "aiven" {
	 api_token = var.aiven_api_token
       }

    You can also set the environment variable ``AIVEN_TOKEN`` for the ``api_token`` property. With this, you don't need to pass the ``-var-file`` flag when executing Terraform commands.

    2. To avoid including sensitive information in source control, the variables are defined here in the ``variables.tf`` file. You can then use a ``*.tfvars`` file with the actual values so that Terraform receives the values during runtime, and exclude it.

    The ``variables.tf`` file defines the API token, the project name to use, and the prefix for the service name:

    .. code:: terraform

       variable "aiven_api_token" {
	 description = "Aiven console API token"
	 type        = string
       }

       variable "project_name" {
	 description = "Aiven console project name"
	 type        = string
       }

    3. The ``var-values.tfvars`` file holds the actual values and is passed to Terraform using the ``-var-file=`` flag.

    ``var-values.tfvars`` file:

    .. code:: terraform

       aiven_api_token     = "<YOUR-AIVEN-AUTHENTICATION-TOKEN-GOES-HERE>"
       project_name        = "<YOUR-AIVEN-CONSOLE-PROJECT-NAME-GOES-HERE>"

Setup service and database
--------------------------

``services.tf`` file:

.. code:: terraform

  resource "aiven_clickhouse" "clickhouse" {
    project                 = var.project_name
    cloud_name              = "google-europe-west1"
    plan                    = "startup-16"
    service_name            = "clickhouse-gcp-eu"
    maintenance_window_dow  = "monday"
    maintenance_window_time = "10:00:00"
  }

  resource "aiven_clickhouse_database" "measurements" {
    project                 = var.project_name
    service_name            = aiven_clickhouse.clickhouse.service_name
    name                    = "iot_measurements"
  }

The ``"aiven_clickhouse"`` resource creates an Aiven for ClickHouse service with the project name, choice of cloud, an
Aiven service plan, and a specified service name. The ``"aiven_clickhouse_database"`` resource creates the measurements database.

Grant user's permissions
------------------------

Administrator role - read & write access
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

``access-writer.tf`` file:

.. code-block:: terraform

  // ETL user with write permissions to the IoT measurements DB
  resource "aiven_clickhouse_user" "etl" {
    project      = var.project_name
    service_name = aiven_clickhouse.clickhouse.service_name
    username     = "etl"
  }

  // Writer role that will be granted insert privilege to the measurements DB
  resource "aiven_clickhouse_role" "writer" {
    project      = var.project_name
    service_name = aiven_clickhouse.clickhouse.service_name
    role         = "writer"
  }

  // Writer role's privileges
  resource "aiven_clickhouse_grant" "writer_role" {
    project      = aiven_clickhouse.clickhouse.project
    service_name = aiven_clickhouse.clickhouse.service_name
    role         = aiven_clickhouse_role.writer.role

    privilege_grant {
      privilege = "INSERT"
      database  = aiven_clickhouse_database.measurements.name
      table     = "*"
    }

    privilege_grant {
      privilege = "SELECT"
      database  = aiven_clickhouse_database.measurements.name
      table     = "*"
    }
  }

  // Grant the writer role to the ETL user
  resource "aiven_clickhouse_grant" "etl_user" {
    project      = aiven_clickhouse.clickhouse.project
    service_name = aiven_clickhouse.clickhouse.service_name
    user         = aiven_clickhouse_user.etl.username

    role_grant {
      role = aiven_clickhouse_role.writer.role
    }
  }

The ``"aiven_clickhouse_user"`` resource creates a user that can connect to the cluster. The
``"aiven_clickhouse_role"`` resources creates a role can be granted fine-grained privileged at the table level. The
``"aiven_clickhouse_grant"."writer_role"`` resource specifies the privileges and the scope of their application
using the ``privilege_grant`` nested configuration. Finally, the ``"aiven_clickhouse_grant"."etl_user"`` assigns
the ``writer`` role to the ``etl`` user.

Analyst role - read access
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

``access-analyst.tf`` file:

.. code-block:: terraform

  // Analyst user with read-only access to the IoT measurements DB
  resource "aiven_clickhouse_user" "analyst" {
    project      = var.project_name
    service_name = aiven_clickhouse.clickhouse.service_name
    username     = "analyst"
  }

  // Reader role that will be granted insert privilege to the measurements DB
  resource "aiven_clickhouse_role" "reader" {
    project      = var.project_name
    service_name = aiven_clickhouse.clickhouse.service_name
    role         = "reader"
  }

  // Reader role's privileges
  resource "aiven_clickhouse_grant" "reader_role" {
    project      = aiven_clickhouse.clickhouse.project
    service_name = aiven_clickhouse.clickhouse.service_name
    role         = aiven_clickhouse_role.reader.role

    privilege_grant {
      privilege = "SELECT"
      database  = aiven_clickhouse_database.measurements.name
      table     = "*"
    }
  }

  // Grant the reader role to the Analyst user
  resource "aiven_clickhouse_grant" "analyst_user" {
    project      = aiven_clickhouse.clickhouse.project
    service_name = aiven_clickhouse.clickhouse.service_name
    user         = aiven_clickhouse_user.analyst.username

    role_grant {
      role = aiven_clickhouse_role.reader.role
    }
  }

.. dropdown:: Expand to check out how to execute the Terraform files.

    The ``init`` command performs several different initialization steps in order to prepare the current working directory for use with Terraform. In our case, this command automatically finds, downloads, and installs the necessary Aiven Terraform provider plugins.

    .. code:: shell

       terraform init

    The ``plan`` command creates an execution plan and shows you the resources that will be created (or modified) for you. This command does not actually create any resource; this is more like a preview.

    .. code:: bash

       terraform plan -var-file=var-values.tfvars

    If you're satisfied with the output of ``terraform plan``, go ahead and run the ``terraform apply`` command which actually does the task or creating (or modifying) your infrastructure resources.

    .. code:: bash

       terraform apply -var-file=var-values.tfvars
