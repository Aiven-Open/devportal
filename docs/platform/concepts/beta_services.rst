Service and feature releases
=============================

Before an official release, the lifecycle of new services and features includes a limited availability stage and an early availability stage.


Limited availability
---------------------

The limited availability stage is an initial release that customers can try out. If you are interested in trying a service or feature in this stage, contact the sales team at sales@Aiven.io.


Early availability
-------------------

Features and services in the early availability stage are released to all users with some restrictions on the functionality and `service level agreement <https://aiven.io/sla>`_. They are intended for use in non-production environments, but you can test them with production-like workloads to gauge their behavior under heavy loads. Issues raised for these services and features are considered `low severity <https://aiven.io/support-services>`_.

You can enable most early availability features yourself on the :doc:`feature preview page </docs/platform/howto/feature-preview>` in the user profile. This is also where you can provide feedback about the feature after trying it out.

Using a service in this stage means that you consent to us contacting you to request qualitative feedback. The feedback we receive helps us shape the products you use.


General availability
---------------------

New services and features become generally available once we are confident that they are ready for production use at scale. The duration of the early stages depends on how quickly the service or feature has been adopted by our customers and what changes are required to address the key issues that are discovered.


Billing for limited and early availability services
----------------------------------------------------

Aiven provides credits for you to try out limited and early availability services. Once the credit code expires or you have used all of the credits, you are charged for the service according to the normal rate.
