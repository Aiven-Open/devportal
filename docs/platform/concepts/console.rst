Aiven web console
=================

The `Aiven web console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_ allows you to manage your Aiven services in your web browser.

For example, the console gives you access to the connection details and configuration options for your services, as well as your billing information and invoice history.

When you log in, the console shows you the *Services* view that lists all the services in the currently selected project.

Projects allow you to organize groups of services under different topics. For example, you can apply different billing settings to each project. An empty project is created for you automatically when you sign up and the free credits are attached to this project. Use the **Project** menu on the left of the console to switch between projects and create new ones.
