Corporate billing
=================

Everyone has their preferred way of paying for services. At Aiven, we give you the flexibility to pay by credit card or receive invoices for your Aiven services.

Credit card payments
"""""""""""""""""""""

The default billing method for all new Aiven customers is credit card. All costs accrued over a calendar month are charged on the first day of the following month. 

Services are billed by the hour. The costs are automatically calculated based on the services running in a project. Each project is charged separately.

Invoice payments
"""""""""""""""""

We offer corporate billing options for customers who have at least 1,000 USD in monthly recurring revenue (MRR). This corporate billing option provides monthly invoices that are generated at the end of the month based on actual usage.
The invoices for usage are automatically generated by our backend, and a PDF is emailed to the billing email address configured in the Aiven Console.

Prices for Aiven services are always defined in US dollars, but invoices can also be sent in other currencies. Invoices in different currencies are created based on the exchange rates on the date of the invoice:

-  US dollars (default)

-  Euros

-  Pounds sterling 

-  Swiss francs

-  Danish kroner

-  Norwegian kroner

-  Swedish kronor

-  Australian dollars 

-  Canadian dollars 

Invoices must be paid within 10 days of receipt by a wire transfer to Aiven's bank account at Citibank Europe Plc:
