Trial project features
======================

Aiven platform offers a free 30 day trial to explore the platform along with many managed Aiven service offerings, including: 

* Apache Cassandra®
* Apache Kafka®
* ClickHouse®
* Grafana®
* InfluxDB®
* MySQL
* OpenSearch®
* PostgreSQL®
* Redis®*


.. note:: **A credit card is not required to start a trial.** 
 
When you sign up on Aiven for the first time, a default (trial) project will be created. The trial grants full access to services, the management console, and other access including the REST API, CLI tool and Terraform provider. 

**The trial project has some limitations:**

* Auto-generated trial projects cannot be renamed
* Trial credits cannot be transferred to another project
* A Maximum of **10** VMs can be created
* A Maximum of **1** VPC and **10** VPC peering connections

.. important:: Trial projects should not be used to create production services due to the limitations outlined in this article. 

As your trial credits get closer to zero, it may impact the ability to start new services that will spend your remaining credits too quickly.

For example, starting a new service that will spend remaining credit in less than an hour would not be possible.

When your credits have been used, your service will stay up and running if you have added your credit card to the service. Otherwise we’ll automatically power down your database when the credits run out, but you can restore it by just entering card details.
