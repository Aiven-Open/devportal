Access service logs
===================

Occasionally, there is the need to inspect logs from Aiven services. For example, to debug query performance or inspecting errors caused by a specific workload.

There are three built-in ways to inspect service logs at Aiven:

* For recent events, go to `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_ > your service's page > **Logs** view (available from the sidebat)

  .. Tip::

     Logs can be browsed back in time, but scrolling up several thousand lines is not very convenient.

* For downloading logs rogrammatically with the :ref:`dedicated command <avn-service-logs>`, use :doc:`Aiven CLI </docs/tools/cli>` supports

* For fetching the same information two above methods output, if the programmatic access is needed, use the `ProjectGetServiceLogs API <https://api.aiven.io/doc/#operation/ProjectGetServiceLogs>`_ endpoint.

Log retention policy
--------------------

Service logs are generally retained for a few days, and for some Aiven services up to 14 days maximum. Unless you are using :doc:`logs integration </docs/integrations>` to another service, older logs are not accessible.

If longer retention time or more comprehensive analytics or search functionality is needed, you can setup a :doc:`log integration with an Aiven for OpenSearch速 service </docs/products/opensearch/howto/opensearch-log-integration>`. The integration allows you to configure longer retention times for your service logs, only limited by the disk space available on the Aiven for OpenSearch速 plan you have selected. OpenSearch速 together with OpenSearch速 Dashboards offers comprehensive logs browsing and analytics platform.
