Managed users 
==============

Managed users provides a centralized way of managing all of your organization's users, including editing their profiles, resetting passwords, and :doc:`setting authentication policies </docs/platform/howto/set-authentication-policies>`.

When you :doc:`verify a domain </docs/platform/howto/manage-domains>`, your organization users automatically become managed users. These users are managed through your identitiy provider (IdP), meaning they are provisioned through the IdP. 

Managed users are not allowed to edit their user profiles. They cannot create new organizations unless they are the owner of the organization that they are managed by.

To see a list of all users in your organization go to **Admin** and select **Users**.
