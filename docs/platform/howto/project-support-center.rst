Aiven offers three additional support tiers with faster response times, phone support, and other services. For more information about these tiers, check out the `Aiven support details page <https://aiven.io/support-services>`_ or contact sales@Aiven.io. You can :ref:`upgrade your support tier <upgrade-support-tier>` in the Aiven Console.
