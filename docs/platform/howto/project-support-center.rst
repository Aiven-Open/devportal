Get support in the Aiven Console
=================================

Aiven is committed to providing excellent and responsive support to all of our customers. We monitor our services 24/7 and rapidly address any anomalies.

The Basic support tier is provided to all customers on paid plans. If you are using a free service, you can ask questions in the Aiven Community Forum. 

In addition to the Basic support tier, we offer three additional tiers that offer faster response times, phone support, and other services. For more information about support plans, please see `Aiven support details page <https://aiven.io/support-services>`_ or contact sales@Aiven.io to discuss the paid support options.

You can create and track support requests in the Aiven Support Portal following the instructions on this page. For other services included in your support tier - such as business reviews or disaster recovery planning - contact the sales team at sales@Aiven.io.
