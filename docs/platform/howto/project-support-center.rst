Support

The Basic support tier is provided to all customers on paid service plans. If you are using a free service, you can ask questions in the Aiven Community Forum. 

Aiven offers three additional support tiers with faster response times, phone support, and other services. For more information about these tiers, check out the `Aiven support details page <https://aiven.io/support-services>`_ or contact sales@Aiven.io. You can :ref:`upgrade your support tier <upgrade-support-tier>` in the Aiven Console.
