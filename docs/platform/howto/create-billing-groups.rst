Create billing groups
=====================

With billing groups you can set up billing profiles to be used across all the projects in an organization. A consolidated :doc:`invoice</docs/platform/howto/use-billing-groups>` is created for each billing group. 

More information about billing groups is available in the :doc:`Billing groups article <../concepts/billing-groups>`.
