SAML Authentication
===================

Setting up SAML authentication for Aiven user profile
-----------------------------------------------------

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is a standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider. You can use it with Aiven so that you and your collaborator can use your company’s favorite authentication service. 

Setting up the SAML authentication method
-----------------------------------------

Detailed instructions exist for the following providers:

* Okta

* G-Suite

* Azure AD

* Auth0

If your provider isn't in the list, please contact us at support@aiven.io so we can assist you with the configuration of the provider of your choice.

Logging in with a SAML authentication method
--------------------------------------------

The first step is to link the authentication method to your existing Aiven user profile if you have one, or create a new Aiven profile associated with it. To do that, you first need to get an invite link from your Account manager. 


You have an Aiven profile and are logged in to the Aiven Console
----------------------------------------------------------------

Click on the “Link profile” button. You will be redirected to your SAML provider’s authentication page. 

Once you’ve logged in to the provider, you will be redirected back to the Aiven Console, and the authentication method will be linked to your profile.


You have an Aiven profile and are logged out
--------------------------------------------

Click on the “Login” button. You will be sent to the login page of the Aiven Console, where you can log in as usual, using your password or Google OAuth. After you’re logged in to the Aiven Console, you will be redirected to your SAML provider’s authentication page. 

Once you’ve logged in to the provider, you will be redirected back to the Aiven Console, and the authentication method will be linked to your profile.


You don’t have an Aiven profile
-------------------------------

Click on the “Sign up” button. You will be redirected to your SAML provider’s authentication page. Once you’ve logged in to the provider, you will be redirected back to the Aiven sign page where you can finish the sign up process. Once this is done, you will have your Aiven profile created and associated with your SAML authentication method.
