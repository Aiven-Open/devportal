Update your tax status
======================

You can add your VAT ID in the billing information in the Aiven Console:

1. Click **Billing** and select the billing group that you want to update.
2. Click **Billing information**.
3. In the **Billing Details** section, click **Edit**.
4. Enter your VAT ID and click **Save**. 

.. important::

    Please be aware that you can set up one billing profile per project or create a Billing Group to group costs and consolidate invoices by different business units.
    For further information please refer to :doc:`Billing Groups </docs/platform/concepts/billing-groups>`. 

If needed, you can change the billing address by clicking **Edit** in the **Company  Details** section. Once the billing country has been updated, it will be used in all future invoices. 
Billing estimates are updated approximately once an hour, so it may take up to an hour for the new tax status to become visible on the invoice estimates.
