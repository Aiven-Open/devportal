================

In the `Aiven web console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_, follow these steps to create a new project:

1. Click on **Project** drop down and click on **Create new project**.
2. Give the new project a name.
3. Select an Account to add the project to.

When you create a new project, you will need to enable :doc:`billing for creating new services <docs/platform/howto/list-billing>`.

2. Click on **Settings**. 
3. Type in the new project name in the *Project Name* field.
4. Click on **Save changes**.

   - Except for Aiven for Apache KafkaÂ®, all service types have backups which are restored once you power them back on.
   - Renaming the project will invalidate all of the project's pending invitations.
   - The project name in your existing DNS records will not be updated.
