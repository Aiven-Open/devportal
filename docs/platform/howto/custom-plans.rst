Requesting custom plans
=======================

Our stock plans are designed to cover most common use cases. The plans
are tested and optimized configurations that work well in different
clouds.

Sometimes, especially for very high throughput clusters or other special
use cases, the stock plans might not be an optimal fit. In such cases we
are happy to look into custom plans where the service configurations are
changed to best fit your needs.

Custom plans can be made available for plans starting from 500
USD/month.

Some variables which may be adjusted in custom plans include:

-  Amount of storage

-  Amount and frequency of backups

-  Amount of nodes

-  CPU/RAM configuration per node

The possible configurations depend on several factors, such as the
cloud, region, available instance types and the service type in
question.

For example available memory and CPU configurations may depend on
restrictions imposed by the cloud provider and the instance types
available in the region.

Please feel free to contact us via Intercom or sales@aiven.io for a
quote and the availability of a custom plan.

For the custom plan request, please provide:

-  The **region** and **cloud** you would like it in (e.g. "Google
   cloud, us-east1")

-  The **service type** (e.g. "Kafka" or "PostgreSQL")

-  The name of the **Aiven project** you would like the custom plan
   available for

-  The custom attributes changed vs a stock plan (e.g. "a PostgreSQL
   business-4 but with 900 GB of storage")
