Search for services in Aiven Console
====================================

On the **Current services** page in `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_ you can search for services by keywords and narrow down the results using filters.

Search by keyword
------------------

When you search by keyword, Aiven Console will show all services that have the matching words in the service name, plan, cloud provider, and tags.

Filter search results
----------------------

You can narrow down your search results by clicking **Filter list** and selecting the services, statuses, and providers to filter by.

You can also add filters to the search field yourself. The supported filters are:

* ``service``
* ``status``
* ``provider``
* ``region``

You can add multiple values to filters separated by a comma. For example, this is how you would view all running PostgreSQL® services that are hosted on AWS or Google Cloud::

    service:pg status:running provider:aws,google

You can use these filters alongside keyword searches. For example, to see all powered off Kafka® services with "production" in the name you could use::

    production service:kafka status:poweroff
