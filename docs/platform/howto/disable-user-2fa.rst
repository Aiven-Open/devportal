Disable user 2FA setting
=========================

If you need to disable 2FA settings from your account, reset it from reset your password by clicking on the "forgot your password" link from `web console <https://console.aiven.io/login>`_, then the reset instructions will also disable the 2FA auth so you can re-enable it once you have reset the password.
