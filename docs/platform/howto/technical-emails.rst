Get technical notifications
============================

To stay up to date with the latest news about the services in a project, you can set up notifications for technical contacts for the project. 

Notifications include information about plan sizes, performance, outages and scheduled maintenance. High priority notifications (for example, a plan running out of space) are also sent to project admin users.

Set up email notifications
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

#. In the project, click **Settings**.

#. In the **Technical Emails** section, add the email addresses.

#. Click **Save changes**. 

Set up Slack notifications
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To get notifications in Slack, you can add a Slack channel's or DM email address to the technical contacts for an Aiven project:

#. In Slack, `create an email address for a channel or DM <https://slack.com/help/articles/206819278-Send-emails-to-Slack#h_01F4WDZG8RTCTNAMR4KJ7D419V>`_.

   .. note::
       If you don't see the email integrations option, ask the owner or admin of the workspace or organization to `allow incoming emails <https://slack.com/help/articles/360053335433-Manage-incoming-emails-for-your-workspace-or-organization>`_.

#. In the Aiven Console, go to the project that you want to get notifications for.

#. Click **Settings**.

#. In the **Technical Emails** section, add the email address that you created for the Slack channel or  DM.                


#. Click **Save changes**. 

Alternatively, you can `set up a Slackbot forwarding address <https://slack.com/help/articles/206819278-Send-emails-to-Slack#h_01F4WE06MBF06BBHQNZ1G0H2K5>`_ and use that to automatically forward Aiven's email notifications from your email client.
