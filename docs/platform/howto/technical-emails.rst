Receive technical notifications
===============================

After creating services on Aiven you will want to make sure you stay
up to date with what's happening to them.

To add email addresses to technical notifications:

#. In the project, click **Settings**.

#. In the **Technical Emails** section of the project settings, add the email addresses.

#. Click **Save changes**. 

These users will receive notifications related to plan sizes, performance, outages and upcoming mandatory planned maintenance. If no emails are specified, we will still send some high-priority notifications (such as disks running out of space warnings) to project admin users.
