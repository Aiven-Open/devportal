Add groups to projects
======================

.. important::
    Groups are available as a feature preview and must be :doc:`enabled in the user profile </docs/platform/howto/feature-preview>`.

Give :doc:`groups </docs/platform/howto/manage-groups>` of organization users access to a project and the services in it by adding groups to it. When you add a group, you set the permission level by assigning the group a :doc:`role </docs/platform/reference/project-member-privileges>` for that specific project.

Add groups to a project 
-----------------------

#. In the project, click **Members**.

#. Click **Add groups**.

#. Select the groups that you want to add to the project. 

#. Select a **Role**. This role will be assigned to all users in all selected groups.

#. Click **Add groups**.

You can change a group's role or remove it from a project later from the **Actions** menu for that group.
