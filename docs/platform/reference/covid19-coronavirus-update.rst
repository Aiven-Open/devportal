Aiven actions regarding the COVID-19 virus pandemic

**Overview**

Aiven is committed to preventing the unnecessary spread of the COVID-19 virus and is taking action to limit its impact over Aiven and the whole society.

**Operational capability**

Aiven operational capability is secured by a globally distributed team. 

The Aiven service is implemented as a self-hosting, fully automated platform that requires little human interaction to operate. Nevertheless, the Aiven global Operations team is monitoring the platform and there is a 24/7/365 Operations on-call team that reacts to alerts and escalations that require manual intervention.

The Aiven Operations team is distributed over three offices: Helsinki (Finland), Berlin (Germany) and Sydney (Australia). Each office on its own is capable of maintaining the platform operational without the need to consult other offices.

Operative work is regularly done remotely even under normal circumstances and the global Operations team is fully capable of working from remote locations with a fraction of the entire team available.

Aiven customer support team also operates from the East Coast of the United States in addition to the offices mentioned above, ensuring responsive help for customers at all times.

**Cloud platform providers**
