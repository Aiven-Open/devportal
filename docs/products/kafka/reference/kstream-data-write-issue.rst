Resolving data write issue on Apache Kafka速 Streams 3.6.0
=========================================================

Issue description
------------------
If you are encountering an ``UNKNOWN_SERVER_ERROR`` while producing data using Apache Kafka速 Streams version 3.6.0, it may result in the prevention of data writing. This issue has been identified and logged in the Apache Kafka速 project's issue tracker with the reference: `Kafka-15653 <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15653>`_.

This could lead to errors in broker logs as,

.. code-block:: bash

    "Error processing append operation on partition XXXX (kafka.server.ReplicaManager) java.lang.NullPointerException."


Solution
--------
**Recommended solution:** To address this issue, it is recommended to upgrade your Apache Kafka速 Streams clients to version 3.6.1. This version contains the necessary fixes to resolve the ``UNKNOWN_SERVER_ERROR``.

**Quick workaround:** Alternatively, in the event of encountering a failure requiring an immediate remedy, users can set the ``transaction_partition_verification_enable`` parameter to ``false`` under advanced configuration of the service. This configuration allows Kafka to accept messages despite the existing bug.

.. Important::
    However, it is essential to re-enable ``transaction_partition_verification_enable``  setting once the client is upgraded.

.. Note::
    If the issue persists even after trying the above remedies, please reach out to our support team for further assistance.
