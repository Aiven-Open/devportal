Getting Started with Karapace
=============================

To use Karapace, you need to enable **Karapace Schema registry** and **REST APIs** on your Aiven for Apache KafkaÂ® service. This can be enabled through the Aiven console.

1. In the `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_, click on the service to view its overview screen. 
2. Look for Schema Registry (Karapace) or Apache Kafka REST API (Karapace), and enable the setting for either one of the features based on your requirements. 

To learn more about Karapace and its features, see the `Karapace homepage <https://karapace.io>`_ and `GitHub project <https://github.com/aiven/karapace>`_.

If you use any of our automation or other integrations, the parameters to enable schema registry or REST APIs on your service are named ``schema_registry`` and ``kafka_rest``.
