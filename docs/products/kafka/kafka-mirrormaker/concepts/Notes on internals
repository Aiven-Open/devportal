Offset sync vs. Checkpoints
--------------

"the offset sync records are used internally to create the checkpoint records.You are correct that the checkpoints include everything you need."

``Discussion <https://lists.apache.org/thread/5ogswjbrf875dcg32h43dnzrqkksxpwj>``

Checkpoints capture the consumers state and are replicated. The structure:

1. topic=primary.topic1
2. partition=4
3. group=consumer.group-2
4. upstreamOffset=100
5. offset=102

OffsetSyncs are needed for checkpoints. They are just offset mapping between clusters. The structure:

1. topic=primary.topic1
2. partition=4
3. upstreamOffset=100
4. offset=102

They are emitted when topics are out of sync.
