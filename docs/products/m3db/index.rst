Aiven for M3
============

Aiven for M3 is a fully managed **distributed time series database**, deployable in the cloud of your choice which can bring unlimited scalability and high-availability to your Prometheus monitoring environment and other time series applications.

Why M3?
-------
M3 is a great choice if your organization has a very large volume of metrics to handle, and it can be used as part of your observability solution. 

M3 is highly compatible with other Aiven products for the following tasks:

* To collect metrics with Prometheus: M3DB is designed as a scalable storage backend for Prometheus.
* To write metrics directly from your applications using the InfluxDB-compatible wire protocol.
* To create dashboards and query available features using Grafana and PromQL.

Check out all the features on our `M3 product page <https://aiven.io/m3#full-feature-list>`_. 

.. tip::
   Aiven offers M3 because we ourselves needed a solution that would work with the size of our own metrics - and we love it!
