Getting started
===============

Aiven for Flink is available in the `Aiven console <https://console.aiven.io>`_.

Choose the Apache Flink version, your cloud provider and location to deploy to, then choose which plan to use.

Finally, give the service a name and then select "Create Service", and your new Flink service will start building. While it does that, you can already visit the service overview page to see the details of the service.
