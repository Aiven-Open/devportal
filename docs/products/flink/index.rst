Aiven for Apache Flink
=======================

What is Aiven for Apache Flink?
-------------------------------

Aiven for Apache Flink is a fully managed **distributed processing engine for stateful computations over data streams**, deployable in the cloud of your choice enabling the creation of streaming data pipelines on top of your datasets.


Why Flink?
-----------------

Flink is a processing engine enabling the definition of streaming data pipelines with SQL statements. It can work in batch or streaming mode, it's distributed by default and performs computation at in-memory speed at any scale.

A major benefit of Apache Flink is its versatility. You can use it to implement batch data processing, but also for handling real-time processing for data streams. Compared to more conventional database solutions, where you might have automation to process the accumulated data at certain intervals, working with data streams allows you to analyze and process the data in real time. This means that you can use Apache Flink to configure solutions for real-time alerting or triggering operations instead of using less efficient solutions.

A key part of data stream processing is the ability to filter and transform incoming data in real time. For example, in cases where you have to ensure limited visibility and access to certain data due to compliance requirements, the capability to process incoming data directly can be a significant factor. Using Apache Flink, you can configure data pipelines to handle the incoming data and store or deliver it differently according to the type of the data or content. You can also transform the data according to your needs, or combine sources to enrich the data.

While the optimal solution depends largely on your use case and goals, the fact that SQL is a key part of constructing data pipelines in Apache Flink makes it quite an approachable data stream processing option, even though there are some relevant concepts (such as :doc:`windows <concepts/windows>`, :doc:`watermarks <concepts/watermarks>`, and :doc:`checkpoints <concepts/checkpoints>`) that may be new to people who are already familiar with databases and batch processing.
