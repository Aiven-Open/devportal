Aiven for Apache Flink® service plans
===================================

Aiven for Apache Flink® is available in a few variants (plans or tiers), each offering a different set of features. Explore the Aiven for Apache Flink service plans and find out what they cover to identify the one that best suits your needs.


Service plans

Custom plans
------------

Billing
-------
All Aiven services, including Aiven for Apache Flink, are billed based on actual usage, which means you only pay for what you use: no up-front fees and no termination charges.

The minimum hourly charge unit is one hour. Powering off or deleting a service stops the accumulation of charges immediately. We calculate your final bill based on your consumption over that period and deliver it as a single invoice per project. For generating a consolidated invoice across multiple projects, `manage billing groups in Aiven Console <https://docs.aiven.io/docs/platform/howto/use-billing-groups.html>`_.
