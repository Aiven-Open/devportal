Create Apache Flink® data service integrations
==============================================

With Apache Flink®, you can create streaming data pipelines across services. Aiven for Apache Flink® currently supports Aiven for Apache Kafka®, Aiven for PostgreSQL®, and Aiven for OpenSearch® as sources and targets for Flink applications.

To use Aiven for Apache Kafka, Aiven for PostgreSQL, or Aiven for OpenSearch as a source or target for a Flink application, you will need to integrate the related service with Aiven for Apache Flink.
