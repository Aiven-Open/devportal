SAML authentication on Aiven for OpenSearch速 
====================================================

SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is a standard protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an identity provider (IdP) and a Service Provider (SP). SAML enables users to authenticate themselves to a service provider with credentials from a trusted third-party identity provider without the need to create and manage separate user accounts for each service provider.

SAML authentication on Aiven for OpenSearch速 can enhance the authentication process for users, providing increased security and a more streamlined experience. With SAML, OpenSearch can delegate authentication and authorization to a trusted external identity provider, reducing security risks and simplifying user management. Additionally, SAML allows for Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality, enabling users to access several OpenSearch instances without the need to log in multiple times.


Prerequisites
---------------
* Aiven for OpenSearch速 version 2.4 or later is required. If you are using an earlier version, upgrade to the latest version.
* OpenSearch Security management must be enabled on the Aiven for OpenSearch速 service.
* You will need a SAML identity provider (IdP), the Metadata URL, and IdP entity ID.


Configre SAML on IdP
--------------------

Enabling SAML SSO Authentication for Aiven for OpenSearch requires the configuration of SAML with an Identity Provider (IdP). Since Aiven for OpenSearch supports multiple IdPs, the steps for configuring SAML with your IdP may differ depending on the IdP you are using. It is recommended to refer to your IdP's documentation for detailed instructions on configuring SAML applications.

To enable SAML SSO authentication, make sure you have correctly configured your IdP and have the following two critical parameters:

* **IdP Metadata URL**: The IdP metadata URL provides essential metadata about your IdP, including the certificate used for signing the SAML response.
* **IdP Entity ID** : The IdP Entity ID is the identifier that the IdP uses to recognize itself. To establish trust between Aiven and OpenSearch, Aiven uses the Entity ID value for OpenSearch.
