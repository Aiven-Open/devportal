Aiven for OpenSearch
====================

`OpenSearch <https://opensearch.org>`_ is an open source search and analytics suite including search engine, NoSQL document database, and visualization interface. OpenSearch offers a distributed, full-text search engine based on `Apache Lucene <https://lucene.apache.org/>`_ with a RESTful API interface and support for JSON documents. Aiven for OpenSearch and Aiven for OpenSearch dashboards are available on a cloud of your choice.

.. note::
    OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards projects were forked in 2021 from the formerly open source projects Elasticsearch and Kibana.

Aiven for OpenSearch comes with OpenSearch Dashboards included, giving a fully-featured user interface and visualization platform for your data.


Why OpenSearch?
===============

OpenSearch is a very useful addition to almost any data platform. It is designed to be robust, scalable and to be able to handle a variety of data types and structures. It provides high-performance search functionality for data of any size or type, and with schemaless storage, can index a variety of sources with different data structures.

OpenSearch is widely used for log ingestion and analysis, particularly because it can handle the data volumes involved, and because OpenSearch Dashboards provides a powerful interface to the data, including search, aggregation and analysis functionality.
