pgvector for AI-powered search in Aiven for PostgreSQL速
=======================================================

To represent data in an optimized way, machine learning (ML) models often uses vectors, which are data structures with at least two components: magnitude and direction. In most cases, vectorizing the data is therefore essential before building an ML model. On the vectorized data, you can perform AI-powered operations (such as model training or data augmentation) using diffent tools, one of them being pgvector.

About pgvector
--------------

pgvector is an open-source vector tools for similarity search. It's available as an extension to your Aiven for PostgreSQL速 servies. pgvector introduces capabilities to store and search over data of the vector type (ML-generated embeddings). Applying a specific index type for querying a table, the extension enables you to search for vector's exact nearest or approximate nearest neighbors (data items). 


Vector embeddings
'''''''''''''''''

In machine learning, real-world objects and concepts (text, images, video, or audio) are represented as a set of continuous numbers residing in a high-dimensional vector space. These numerical representations are called vector embeddings, and the process of transformation into numerical representations is called vector embedding. Vector embedding allows ML algorithms to identify semantic and syntactic relationships between data, find patterns patterns, and make predictions. Vector representations have different applications, for example, information retrieval, image classification, sentiment analysis, natural language processing, or similarity search.

Vector similarity
'''''''''''''''''

Since on vector embeddings you can use AI tools for capturing relationships between objects (vector representations), you are also able to identify similarities between them in an easily computable and scalable manner.

A vector usually represents a data point, and components of the vector correspond to attributes of the data point.
In most cases, vector similarity calcualtions use distance metrics, for example, by measuring the straight-line distance between two vectors or the cosine of the angle between two vectors. The greater the resulting value of the similarity calculation is, the more similar the vectors are, with 0 as the minimum value and 1 as the maximum value.

How pgvector works
------------------

1. You generate embeddings for your data, for example, for products catalog.
2. You store the embeddings in Aiven for PostgreSQL using the pgvector extension.
3. You use the embedings for the vector similarity search on products catalog.

Why use pgvector
----------------

With the pgvector extension, you can perform the vector similarity search and use embeddings techniques directly in Aiven for PostgreSQL. pgvector allows for efficient handling of high-dimensional vector data within the Aiven for PostgreSQL database for tasks such as similarity search, clustering, or machine learning.

pgvector helps you optimize and personalize the similarity search experience by improving searching speed and accuracy.

Typical use cases
-----------------

There are multiple industry applications for similarity searches over vector embeddings:

* e-commerce
* recommendation systems
* fraud detection

.. topic:: Examples
    
    * AI-powered tools can find similarities between products or transactions, which can be used to produce product recommendations or detect potential scams or frauds.
    * Sentiment analysis: words represented with similar vector embeddings have similar sentiment scores.
