Migrating to Aiven for PostgreSQL using Bucardo
===============================================

How to migrate your database to Aiven from an older version of PostgreSQL without downtime

The preferred approach to migrating a database to Aiven for PostgreSQL is to use `the built-in migration tool <4358591.html>`_. However, if you are running PostgreSQL 9.6 or do not have ``superuser`` access to your database to add replication slots, you can use the open source `Bucardo <https://bucardo.org>`_ tool to allow replication to Aiven.

**Requirements:**

* An Aiven for PostgreSQL database
* Your current database
* A computer with Bucardo installed on it
* Connectivity between your current database, the Aiven database, and Bucardo

To migrate your data using Bucardo:

1. Install Bucardo using `the installation instructions <https://bucardo.org/Bucardo/installation/>`_ on the Bucardo site.

   
2. Install the ``aiven_extras`` extension to your current database.

   Bucardo requires the superuser role to set the ``session_replication_role`` parameter. Aiven uses the open source ``aiven_extras`` extension to allow you to run ``superuser`` commands as a different user, as direct ``superuser`` access is not provided for security reasons.

   
3. Open and edit the ``Bucardo.pm`` file with administrator privileges.

   The location of the file can vary according to your operating system, but you might find it in ``/usr/local/share/perl5/5.32/Bucardo.pm``, for example.

   

   a. Scroll down until you see a ``disable_triggers`` function, on line 5324 in the following example:

      .. image:: pictures/c7a228ff32d38175b985f5c1_image.png

   b. On line 5360, change ``SET session_replication_role = default`` to the following:

      ::

        $dbh->do(q{select aiven_extras.session_replication_role('replica');});

   c. Scroll down to the ``enable_triggers`` function:

      .. image:: pictures/2e5df9c2bbbef40dfcfb979e_image.png

   d. On line 5429, change ``SET session_replication_role = default`` to the following:

      ::

        $dbh->do(q{select aiven_extras.session_replication_role('origin');});

   e. Save your changes and close the file.

      

4. Add your source and destination databases.

   For example:

   ::

     bucardo add db srcdb dbhost=0.0.0.0 dbport=5432 dbname=all_your_base dbuser=$DBUSER dbpass=$DBPASS
     
     bucardo add db destdb dbhost=cg-pg-dev-sandbox.aivencloud.com dbport=21691 dbname=all_your_base dbuser=$DBUSER dbpass=$DBPASS

5. Add the tables that you want to replicate:

   ::

     bucardo add table belong to us herd=$HERD db=srcdb

   You can set ``$HERD`` to any name you choose for the herd, which is used to set up the synchronization.

   
6. Dump and restore the database from your source to Aiven:

   ::

     pg_dump --schema-only --no-owner all_your_base > base.sql
     psql "$AIVEN_DB_URL" < base.sql

   You can restore the source data or provide only the schema, depending on the size of your current database.

   
7. Create the ``dbgroup`` for Bucardo:

   ::

     bucardo add dbgroup src_to_dest srcdb:source destdb:target
     bucardo add sync sync_src_to_dest relgroup=$HERD db=srcdb,destdb
     (sudo) bucardo start
     bucardo status sync_src_to_dest

8. Start Bucardo and run the ``status`` command.

   This should give you output similar to the following example:

   .. image:: pictures/c86cb192ea31a6541797a31c_image.png

   When ``Current state`` is ``Good``, the data is flowing to your Aiven database.

   
9. Log in to the Aiven web console and go to the **Current Queries** tab for your service.

   This shows you that the ``bucardo`` process is inserting data:

   .. image:: pictures/c257a4b3a707e19f83cb5be7_image.png

#. Once all your data is synchronized, switch the database connection for your applications to the Aiven service URI.
