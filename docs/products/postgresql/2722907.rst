Getting access to the PostgreSQL "public" schema
================================================

How to transfer ownership of the "public" schema to your "avnadmin" user

To claim ownership of the ``public`` schema, use the ``aiven_extras`` extension as the ``avnadmin`` database user:

::

  CREATE EXTENSION aiven_extras CASCADE;
  
  SELECT * FROM aiven_extras.claim_public_schema_ownership();


After this, ``avnadmin`` owns the schema and can modify it.
