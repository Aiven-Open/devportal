Missing PostgreSQL Datadog Metrics
==================================

Where to find the table-specific metrics that are described in the Datadog documentation

Based on the Datadog `PostgreSQL integration documentation <https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/postgres/?tab=host#data-collected>`_, there are a variety of different metrics recorded by the Datadog agent. However, only some of these are available in Aiven for PostgreSQL services.

Currently, Aiven for PostgreSQL reports **server** and **database** metrics, but not **table** (relation) or **statement** metrics.

If you want to be notified when these table-level metrics are configurable for customers, please reach out to support at `support@aiven.io <mailto:support@aiven.io>`_.
