PostgreSQL superuser access
===========================

How superuser access is handled in Aiven for PostgreSQL

Currently, we do not allow superuser access to Aiven PostgreSQL services. However, most actions that are typically done as a superuser can be performed in a different way in Aiven.

The default ``avnadmin`` database user has permissions to do most of the usual DB management operations, for example:

* Managing databases (``CREATE DATABASE`` , ``DROP DATABASE`` )
* Creating database users (``CREATE USER/ROLE`` ,`` DROP USER/ROLE`` )
* Creating extensions in databases (``CREATE EXTENSION`` )
* Managing access permissions (``GRANT`` , ``REVOKE`` )
* Logical replication as it has the REPLICATION privilege 

You can also manage databases and users in the Aiven web console or though our REST API.

You can use the grant system to limit access to different users. Various commands, such as the ``TRUNCATE``

A number of extensions can be installed in Aiven PostgreSQL databases without superuser access, see `the list of extensions <https://help.aiven.io/supported-postgresql-extensions>`_ for more information.

In addition, the ``aiven_extras`` extension contains additional superuser-like functionality that you can do as ``avnadmin`` that normally require superuser privileges. This includes things like PostgreSQL built-in logical replication and ``auto_explain`` usage.
