Getting Started
===============

PostgreSQL is available in the `Aiven console <https://console.aiven.io>`_.

Choose the PostgreSQL version, your cloud provider and location to deploy to, then choose which plan to use.

.. note::
    If you're just trying out PostgreSQL, a single-node setup is available with our startup and hobbyist plans. This isn't recommended for production use however; for that you should try the the high availability pairs provided on the business plans, or a premium plan to meet your needs.

Finally, give the service a name and then select "Create Service", and your shiny new PostgreSQL database will start building. While it does that, you can already visit the service overview page to see the details of the service.

Connection details
------------------

The direct connection endpoint can be found under the **Service URI** connection information on the main service overview tab.
