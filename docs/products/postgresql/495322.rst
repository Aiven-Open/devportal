I imported my PostgreSQL database and I'm getting poor performance
==================================================================

How to handle performance issues after importing your database to Aiven for PostgreSQL

Whenever you load data with ``pg_restore`` or similar tools, run ``ANALYZE`` or ``VACUUM ANALYZE`` on your entire database to collect new statistics.

Without these operations, the database will not have up-to-date statistics on the tables and indexes, which may in turn lead to poor query plans.

This can also be the case after performing a major version upgrade since optimizer statistics are not transferred to the upgraded database.

For more details about ``ANALYZE``, see the PostgreSQL documentation: `https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-analyze.html <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-analyze.html>`_
