Create additional PostgreSQL databases
=============================================

Once you've created your Aiven for PostgreSQL service, you can add additional databases, whether for security purposes or to isolate your data per application.


1. In the Aiven console, on the **Services** page, click on the Aiven for PostgreSQL service name for which you want to create a new database.

2. Select the **Databases** tab:

   a. Enter a name for your database.

3. Click **Add database** on the right hand side of the console.

   The new database will be visible immediately.

You can also use the :doc:`Aiven client </tools/cli/database#manage-databases>` or the :doc:`PostgreSQL client<connect-from-cli>` to create your database from the CLI.
