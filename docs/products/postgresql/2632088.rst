Using the pg_repack extension
=============================

How to repack your PostgreSQL table

``pg_repack`` is a PostgreSQL extension that allows you to efficiently reorganize a table to get rid of any excess that it has accumulated. Note that reorganizing a table may take some time, but ``pg_repack`` tries to minimize the locks required so that online operations continue.

To use the ``pg_repack`` extension:

1. Run the following command as ``avnadmin``:

   ::

     CREATE EXTENSION pg_repack;

2. Run the command-line tool that comes with the extension on your own machine.

   The command to reorganize a single table looks like the following:

   ::

     pg_repack -d connstr --no-superuser-check -t tablename

   This reorganizes the ``tablename`` table.
