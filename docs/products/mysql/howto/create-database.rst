Create additional MySQL databases
==================================

Once you've created your Aiven for MySQL service, you can add additional databases, whether for security purposes or to isolate your data per application.


Use the Aiven console
----------------------------

1. On the **Services** page, click on the Aiven for MySQL service name for which you want to create a new database.

2. Select the **Databases** tab:

   a. Enter a name for your database.

3. Click **Add database** on the right hand side of the console.

   The new database will be visible immediately.

You can also use the :doc:`Aiven client </tools/cli/database#manage-databases>` or the :doc:`MySQL client<connect-from-cli>` to create your database  from the CLI.
