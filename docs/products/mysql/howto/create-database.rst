Create additional Aiven for MySQL® databases
============================================

Once you've created your Aiven for MySQL® service, you can add additional databases, whether for security purposes or to isolate your data per application.

To create a new MySQL® database, take the following steps:

1. Log in to `Aiven Console <https://console.aiven.io/>`_.
2. In the **Services** page, select an Aiven for MySQL service for which you want to create a new database.
3. In your service's page, select **Databases** from the sidebar.
4. In the **Databases** view, select **Create database**.
5. In the **Create a new database** window, enter a name for your database into the **Name** field and select **Add database**.

   The new database will be visible immediately.

.. Tip::

   You can also use the :ref:`Aiven client <avn-service-database-create>` or the :doc:`MySQL client<connect-from-cli>` to create your database from the CLI.
