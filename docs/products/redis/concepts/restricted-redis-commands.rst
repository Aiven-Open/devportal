In this section, you can find information about Redis commands that are restricted or modified in our Aiven for Redis* service.

.. note:: 
    For enhanced security, certain admin commands are renamed. The renaming involves appending a suffix to the command name. This suffix is determined by the service configuration and is typically known only to our administrative team.
