     - Recommended approach
   * - Backups - one snapshot a day
     - | Since Aiven for ClickHouse service takes a single snapshot a day only,
       |
       | - When powering off the service, all data after the last backup is lost.
       | - Point-in-time recovery is not supported. A database can be restored to one of the daily backups states only.
       | - When creating a database fork, you can only create a fork that matches the state of one of the backups.
       | - Any data inserted before the next snapshot is lost if all nodes in a given shard malfunction and need to be replaced.
       |
       | This limitation doesn't apply to patches, migrations, or scaling, which are handled safely and automatically.

   * - Table engines availability
     - * Log engine is not supported in Aiven for ClickHouse.

       * Some special table engines and the Log engine are not supported in Aiven for ClickHouse.

       * Some engines are remapped to their ``Replicated`` alternatives, for example, ``MergeTree`` **>** ``ReplicatedMergeTree``.
     - * For storing data, use the `Buffer engine <https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/engines/table-engines/special/buffer/>`_ instead of the Log engine.

       * Use the available table engines listed in :doc:`Supported table engines in Aiven for ClickHouse </docs/products/clickhouse/reference/supported-table-engines>`.
   * - Cloud availability
     - Available on AWS, GCP, and Azure only
     - Use the available cloud providers.
   * - Kafka Schema Registry

     - \-
   * - Querying all shards at once
     - If you have a sharded plan, you must use a Distributed view on top of your MergeTree table to query all the shards at the same time, and you should use it for inserts too.
     - Use the ``Distributed`` view with sharded plans.
   * - ON CLUSTER queries
     - Aiven for ClickHouse doesn't support ON CLUSTER queries because it actually runs each data definition query on all the servers of the cluster without using `ON CLUSTER`.
     - Run queries without ``ON CLUSTER``.
   * - Creating a database using SQL
     - You cannot create a database directly using SQL, for example, if you'd like to add a non-default database.
     - Use the Aiven's public API.
   * - Scaling down the number of nodes
     - You only can scale up the number of nodes in a cluster.
