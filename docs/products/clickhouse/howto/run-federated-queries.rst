Run federated queries from Aiven for ClickHouseÂ®

Access and permissions
''''''''''''''''''''''

To run a federated query, the ClickHouse service user connecting to the cluster requires grants to the S3 and/or URL sources. The main service user is granted access to the sources by default, and new users can be allowed to use the sources with the following query:

.. code-block:: bash

   GRANT CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE, S3, URL ON *.* TO <username> [WITH GRANT OPTION]


The CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE grant is required for both sources. Adding WITH GRANT OPTION allows the user to further transfer the privileges.
