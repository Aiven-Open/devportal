How can I contribute?
---------------------

**Reporting bugs, and suggesting enhancements**
If you notice something is off (anything - from typos to incorrect instructions) or missing, consider opening an issue. 
.. tip::
    Before you open an issue, check the article request backlog, and all other open issues for the devportal. 

**Contributing via pull requests (PR)**
If you have your own article to add or you want to modify an existing article yourself, here's what you do:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Make your update.
3. Open a pull request (make sure you use a helpful PR and commit message). 
4. Submit your PR, and get it reviewed (one reviewer is required). 

We'll merge it!

.. note::
    Our build runs several checks on your updates - from linting to spell check to broken links to help you commit good content. Look at the **Checks** section in your pull request to make sure everything passes. If anything fails, check the error details, or reach out to us, and we'll help you. 

**Style tips**
If you're writing content, here are some high-level tips that can be useful.

- Decide what type of content you want to contribute (check content model), and use our content type templates - for concept, task, reference and tutorial.

- Write a good title (start with a verb for tasks, and noun for concepts). 

- Note down your main ideas, and decide what formatting will best support these (use the content templates):
    - Ordered lists - for tasks
    - Paragraphs - for definitions and explanations
    - Lists and tables - for reference/options

- Highlight information by using the following elements:
    - Tips - for interesting facts about parts of your content/alternative ways of doing something, and shortcuts
    - Warnings - for important facts readers need to know before proceeding
    - Info - for any extra information (this may be skipped)

- Add good links (internal and external) - properly formatted, to reputable sources of information.

- Choose your visuals (images, diagrams, screenshots) and include them in a specified size (no bigger than…).
