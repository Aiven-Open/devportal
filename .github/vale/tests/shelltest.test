# A file of tests to be run with shelltest.
#
# See https://github.com/simonmichael/shelltestrunner
#
# On a Mac, install with `brew install shelltestrunner`
#
# Also needs Vale (as used by `make spell` at the top level). Again, on a Mac
# that can be installed with `brew install vale`
#
# For the moment there's only one test file for all the tests - this may change.
#
# Run with:
#
#    $ shelltest --diff .github/vale/tests/shelltest.test
#
# or, for instance:
#
#    $ shelltest --diff --with vale-2.15.1 .github/vale/tests/shelltest.test
#
# I'd like to use the undocumented `--sort` switch for the vale CLI command.
# This does what it sounds like, outputting the messages in a deterministic
# order. Although it's not documented (or mentioned in the `--help` text),
# it *is* used in vale's own tests of itself, so we should be safe using it.
# Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be stable for different issues reported
# on the same line (presumably because the vale test code doesn't care about
# that). It's probably worth checking every so often to see if it has become
# stable in such cases.

# PROBLEMS:
# * line 20 <Apache Nonesuch> should probably provoke an error, but does not
#   - that's because I haven't written the style code to make it so
# * line 27 <``literal-text`` MirrorMaker2> should definitey provoke an error, but does not
#   - that's definitely some sort of bug, as see line 28
