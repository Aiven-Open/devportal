# A file of tests to be run with shelltest.
#
# See https://github.com/simonmichael/shelltestrunner
#
# On a Mac, install with `brew install shelltest`
#
# For the moment there's only one test file for all the tests - this may change.
#
# Run with:
#
#    $ shelltest --diff .github/vale/tests/shelltest.test
#
# or, for instance:
#
#    $ shelltest --diff --with vale-2.15.1 .github/vale/tests/shelltest.test
#
# NOTE that the order of output of error messages from vale does not seem to be
# deterministic. This has been evident with `.github/vale/tests/bad.rst`.
# The simplest solution for our purposes is to run the result through `sort`,
# although then we lost the ability to test the return code - although for
# these tests I don't think I'm concerned with testing the vale return code.
#
# NOTE that working out what is going on when deciding if the output is what
# is actually expected is best done *without* `sort`, as line numbers don't
# sort in order.

# PROBLEMS:
# * line 20 <Apache Nonesuch> should probably provoke an error, but does not
#   - that's because I haven't written the style code to make it so
# * line 27 <``literal-text`` MirrorMaker2> should definitey provoke an error, but does not
#   - that's definitely some sort of bug, as see line 28
